            A block is moving on a plane by the driving of a driving factor $u$. $u$ drives the block through the coefficient $k_{\rm drive}$. The driving force is:\\
            \[F_{\rm drive} = k_{\rm drive}\cdot u\].\\
            Meanwhile, it can be slowed down by a friction force, the friction coefficient is $k_{\rm fric}$. So friction force equals to $k_{\rm fric}\cdot G$, where $G = mg$. However, the friction force disappears at the instant the block stops. So the friction force can be calculated as following:
            \[F_{\rm fric} = - k_{\rm fric}\cdot G\cdot {\rm sign}(v)\]
            Where $v$ is the velocity of the block. The positive direction is the absolute positive direction.
